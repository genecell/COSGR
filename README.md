# COSG (R version)

Accurate and fast cell marker gene identification with COSG


COSG is a cosine similarity-based method for more accurate and scalable marker gene identification.

* COSG is a general method for cell marker gene identification across different data modalities, e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and spatially resolved transcriptome data.
* Marker genes or genomic regions identified by COSG are more indicative and with greater cell-type specificity.
* COSG is ultrafast for large-scale datasets, and is capable of identifying marker genes for one million cells in less than two minutes.

The method and benchmarking results are described in [Dai et al., (2021)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.448484v1).

Here is the R version for COSG, and the python version is hosted in https://github.com/genecell/COSG.
